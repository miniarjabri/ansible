## beginner friendly: 
-create a user
-remove a user
-create a user with a specific UID/GID and make sure it’s in a particular group.
-add ssh keys to said user
-create a file
-delete the file
-use the template module to create a file. Put the amount of memory the system has in a file.
-Now edit an existing file by adding some lines. Add another DNS server or repo to your package manager
-Now add some lines in the middle of a file. Use regex to determine where to put the added lines.
-remove lines from a file. Even if it’s a comment, just practice taking it out.
-install some programs
